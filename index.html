            <p>Despite acquisitions and divestitures toward these objectives valued in the tens of billions of dollars,
                Nestle executives are acknowledging that the majority of its food and beverage products still fail to
                meet recognized standards for healthful foods, according to an article published by The Financial Times.
                In response to the article, Nestle told the publication it was updating its nutrition and health
                strategy.</p>
