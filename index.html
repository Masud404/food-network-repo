                <p>A presentation circulated among top executives this year, seen by the Financial Times, says only 37%
                    of
                    Nestle’s food and beverages by revenues, excluding products such as pet food and specialized medical
                    nutrition, achieve a rating above 3.5 under Australia’s health star rating system,” The Times said.
                    “This system scores foods out of five stars and is used in research by international groups such as
                    the
